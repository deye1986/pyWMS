Mini warehouse management system that generates a SKU (stock keeping unit) that takes the first 2 letters of the item name and the first 2 of the category, to be further developed. The paradigm is OOP.

App now creates and saves sku's to a text file.
App creates unique sku's for a named item and stores the item details in an inventory.txt file.
