Mini warehouse management system that generates a SKU (stock keeping unit) that takes the first 2 letters of the item name and the first 3 
of the category, to be further developed. The paradigm is OOP.

App creates unique sku's for a named item and stores the item details in an inventory.txt file. \n
App determines location of item in warehouse based on item data and appends inventory.txt. \n
