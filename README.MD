Prior to this log an issue was discovered. The layout manager method; grid() was positioning widgets<br>
in relation to other widgets which presented a GUI issue. To resolve this, place(), grid() and pack()<br>
layout manager methods were considered but for ease of use and relative simplicity of organizing widgets<br>
